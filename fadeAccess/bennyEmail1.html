<p style= "margin: 30px;font-size:20px;">Hello Benny, it's good to be able to contact you again. I hope you have been enjoying
    your time off in Vegas, because its coming to an end. As you know, all those years ago, that atrocious SSDA managed to strike us down,
    and claimed the life of one of our best, possibly THE best, agents to date, Ryan Wally AKA the Jade Monkey.<br><br>
    Our organization was forced to go into hiding, and we lost considerable leverage all over the world.
    <br><br>
    But the time of hiding is over. We are recruiting new agents and reassembling the agency. I need YOU back at the helm of my
    security team. You were, after all, one of the best agents I had.<br><br>
    So again, I hope you enjoyed those white tigers and magic shows, because its time for FADE to make a comeback.
    You already know the rendevous point. I'll see you there, Agent Bear.<br><br>
    Oh, and...don't be too surprised to see a familiar face when you arrive.
    <br>
    Ember out.
