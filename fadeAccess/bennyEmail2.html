    Hey man, I know going into hiding is going to be tough. But its the best option right now after
    that crippling loss. We don't have the resources available to keep everyone safe.
    But keep your head up! I'm your agent handler man, and I care about you guys, so I set you
    up with ALL the bells and whistles. You'll get the booking information in the mail.
    Don't gamble your life savings away!
    <br><br>
    Also, its no secret that this 'agency' is more than just that, its a family. And being isolated
    from your family can be a big deal. So please, if you ever need anything, just let me know.
    We have to stay off of the FADE network for the time being, so my new email is murderofcrows@gmail.com.
    <br><br>
    Hang in there Benny! And hey, at least now I'll have time to read up all that literature you keep recommending to me!
    <br><br>
    -Sammy
