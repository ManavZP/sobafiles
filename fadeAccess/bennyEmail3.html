<h1 style="margin:30px;">Subject: Welcome to F.A.D.E.</h1>
<p style= "margin: 30px;font-size:20px;">
    At F.A.D.E., we strive to do the most evil we possibly can. For years,
    our primary directive has been setting up, and putting into motion, plots
    to take over the world, destroy livelihoods, and even just inconvenience
    people's everyday lives. 
    <br><br>
    Its possible that you or a loved one were directly impacted by our actions
    prior to working here. But fear not! Now that you are an agent of F.A.D.E., you and
    the people you love are protected by our wrongdoings indefinitely.
    <br><br>
    And that is just one of the many, MANY benefits to being an agent of F.A.D.E.!
    <br><br>
    We are excited to get to know you, and we hope you are excited to get to know us!
    You will learn more about the agency and your role at orientation next week.
    <br><br>
    Stay Evil!
    <br><br>
    F.A.D.E.
